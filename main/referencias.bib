The practical importance of this problem has been established some decades ago, but it has received very little attention from researchers. In this paper we present a new tabu search algorithm that explores the structure of this type of problem and we compare its performance with another heuristic designed for the same purpose, which has been published recently."

abstract = "With an ever increasing number of vehicles traveling the roads, traffic problems such as congestions and increased travel times became a hot topic in the research community, and several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of the traffic networks. This paper introduces the Inverted Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) algorithm, a variation of the classic Ant Colony algorithm that inverts its logic by converting the attraction of ants towards pheromones into a repulsion effect. IACO is then used in a decentralized traffic management system, where drivers become ants that deposit pheromones on the followed paths; they are then repelled by the pheromone scent, thus avoiding congested roads, and distributing the traffic through the network. Using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), several experiments were conducted to compare the effects of using IACO with a shortest time algorithm in artificial and real world scenarios – using the map of a real city, and corresponding traffic data. The effect of the behavior caused by this algorithm is a decrease in traffic density in widely used roads, leading to improvements on the traffic network at a local and global level, decreasing trip time for drivers that adhere to the suggestions made by IACO as well as for those who do not. Considering different degrees of adhesion to the algorithm, IACO has significant advantages over the shortest time algorithm, improving overall network performance by decreasing trip times for both IACO-compliant vehicles (up to 84) and remaining vehicles (up to 71). Thus, it benefits individual drivers, promoting the adoption of IACO, and also the global road network. Furthermore, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from both vehicle types decrease significantly when using IACO (up to 49)."

Two specific features of ACE are: the division of tasks between two kinds of ants, namely patrollers and foragers, and the implementation of a regulation policy to control the number of each kind of ant during the searching process. In addition, ACE does not employ the construction graph usually employed by classical ACO algorithms. Instead, the search is performed using a state space exploration approach. This paper studies the performance of ACE in the context of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classical combinatorial optimisation problem. The results are compared with the results of two well known ACO algorithms: ACS and MMAS. ACE shows better performance than ACS and MMAS in almost every TSP tested instance."

The proposed algorithm for the solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMOTSP), combines a Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm, the Multiple Phase Neighborhood Search-Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (MPNS-GRASP) algorithm and the Expanding Neighborhood Search Strategy. Besides these two procedures, the proposed algorithm has, also, two additional main innovative features compared to other Honey Bees Mating Optimization algorithms concerning the crossover operator and the workers. The main contribution of this paper is that it shows that the HBMO can be used in hybrid synthesis with other metaheuristics for the solution of the TSP with remarkable results both to quality and computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was tested on a set of 74 benchmark instances from the TSPLIB and in all but eleven instances the best known solution has been found. For the rest instances the quality of the produced solution deviates less than 0.1{\%} from the optimum."

In order to improve the speed of our taboo search, two parallelization methods are proposed and their efficiencies shown for a number of processors proportional to the size of the problem. The best published solutions to many of the biggest problems have been improved and every previously best solution (probably optimal) of smaller problems has been found. In addition, an easy way of generating random problems is proposed and good solutions of these problems, whose sizes are between 5 and 100, are given."

While the underlying philosophy of jump search — applying local search from different starting points — has been discussed in the literature previously (using random starting points), the use of construction-based heuristic solutions has heretofore not been considered. Extensive empirical analysis shows the method to be surprisingly effective vis a vis a randomized strategy and in comparison with tabu search. The approach is quite robust and suggests that a systematic search among neighborhoods of good, not random, solutions provides distinct advantages. This suggests that further research be focused on better construction heuristics and hybrid schemes that incorporate jump search in, for example, tabu search."

This survey sets out to review recent research in this area, including different optimization approaches, and to provide guidelines and promising directions for future research.

In this paper we present a classification to understand the key aspects of existing ridesharing systems. The objective is to present a framework that can help identify key challenges in the widespread use of ridesharing and thus foster the development of effective formal ridesharing mechanisms that would overcome these challenges and promote massification."
